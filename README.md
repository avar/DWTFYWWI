# The DWTFYWWI license

The [DWTFYWWI](http://github.com/avar/DWTFYWWI) license is a parody of
the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) I wrote in 2006. It's
used by a few small software packages (mainly in MediaWiki).

I don't use the DWTFYWWI license myself, mostly because I'm usually
working on projects that are already under a different license. Or
projects that need to use libraries that prohibit these sort of terms.

# Alternatives

If you want a less humorous and permissive license you might want to
check out the
[MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), or
the public domain terms
[SQLite is distributed](http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html) under.
